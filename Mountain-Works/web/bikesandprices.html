<p>There are a variety of different bike classes available, some of which offer dual-suspension, some are electric, there are even bikes that have both-- dual-suspension and electric then there are bikes that only offer single suspension (also known as a ‘hardtail’). It is also important to note that each bike class will cause a variation in their prices. These different classes of bikes cater to different riding styles and terrains. It is important you choose the appropriate bike type for the style of riding you aim to do. For example, if you plan on riding more technical, downhill and steep terrain, we recommend you purchase a bike that offers dual suspension. As it allows you to not only have a smoother ride, but also allows you to attack the trail as much as you want- without breaking yourself.
